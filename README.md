This repository contains my implementations of :
1.Graph Theory
      1. Dijkstra Algorithm
      2. Krushkal Algorithm
      3. Topological Sorting 
      4. Toplogical Labelling
2. Bignum :  Bignum *b = new Bignum("1234532"); // any string
      1. Multiply two Bignums : multiply(b1, b2, product, sizeOfProduct);
      2. Add two Bignums : multiply(b1, b2, sum, sizeOfSum);
      Product and sum contains the final answer after multiplication and addition respectively.
      
      sizeofProduct/sum is just a var which is always passed by reference and is equal to size of final array(product[] or sum[]).
